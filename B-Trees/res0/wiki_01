SaturnShuttle
The SaturnShuttle was a preliminary concept of launching the Space Shuttle orbiter using the Saturn V rocket It was studied and considered in 19711972

An interstage would be fitted on top of the SIC stage to support the external tank in the space occupied by the SII stage in the Saturn V It was an alternative to the SRBs

The addition of wings and some form of landing gear on the SIC stage would allow the booster to fly back to the Kennedy Space Center where technicians would then refurbish the booster by replacing only the five F1 engines and reusing the tanks and other hardware for later flights

The Shuttle would handle space station logistics while Saturn V would launch components 
This would have allowed a space station using a Skylab or Mir configuration with docking ports to have been lifted with just a handful of launches The SaturnShuttle concept also would have eliminated the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters that ultimately precipitated the Space Shuttle Challenger accident in 1986

Because the shuttle orbiter would be riding piggyback on the external tank and the need to prevent damage to the delicate thermal protection tiles the fiveengine variant of the SaturnShuttle would require the center engine to be shut down 45 to 50 seconds after launch while two of the outboard engines would have to be shut down prior to staging Once the SIC was jettisoned the three onboard highenergy Space Shuttle main engines would then propel the orbiter into LEO shutting down 65 minutes after ignition The external tank would then be jettisoned as on the actually flown shuttle configuration and the orbiter would then perform its mission

But because of the need to keep costs down and to allow President Richard Nixon to approve the shuttle program in 1972 NASA decided to utilize segmented solid rocket boosters similar to those used on the Titan III rocket instead of the SIC thus ending the Saturn program after the initial Saturn V order was completed
